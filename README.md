# Inflation Calculation

Program written in Python that calculates inflation in 8 product prices for 203 districts of Uzbekistan.
When you run the program, a folder called **Inflation_Rate** is created on Desktop. The program was written 
to automate a weekly report that used to take four hours each time.

To use the program, run the **main.py** , place two Excel files containing product price data inside 
the **Inflation_Rate** folder, input the names of the Excel files in corresponding input boxes and
click on the `Calculate` button. The result will be saved as an Excel file in the same folder.
